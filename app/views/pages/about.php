                <p>Our group worked collaboratively to develop Spots Charity, a website that provides a platform for
                    users to support charitable causes through donations and other engagement options. Our organization
                    aims to create a space that fosters community involvement and streamlines the donation process,
                    making it easier for individuals to contribute to causes they care about. Looking ahead, we envision
                    expanding Spots Charityâ€™s functionalities to include more interactive features and partnerships with
                    charitable organizations, enhancing both user experience and impact.</p>
                <p>Through various programs, we aim to empower young athletes and foster a sense of community. Join
                    us
                    in our journey to make a positive impact!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Chengwei Yan</b> was responsible for designing the CSS styling and JavaScript framework for
                        the front end. He led the architecture of the website routing, ensuring a structured navigation
                        system. Chengwei also designed the main page, donation page, and login page, handling code
                        validation, testing, and the maintenance of the GitHub dev branch.</li>
                    <li><b>Wentao Su</b> focused on designing the CSS and JavaScript framework for the front end as
                        well. He oversaw the dashboard design for users and organizations, and developed the
                        authentication for the user panel categorization. Wentao contributed to bug fixes in the main
                        page and login page and managed code validation, testing, and GitHub main branch maintenance.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Ruilin Hu</b> worked on gathering image assets and proofreading text content for the website.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Wentai Ge</b> supported the team by collecting image resources and assisting with text
                        proofreading.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3 class="mt-4">Project Highlights</h3>
                <p>One of the most exciting aspects of our work on Spots Charity was the opportunity to create a website
                    with a meaningful purpose. Our website is designed to make charitable donations more accessible and
                    organized, allowing users to interact with causes in a streamlined, user-friendly environment. The
                    team's collaboration on this project, blending our skills in design, programming, and quality
                    assurance, made the process both engaging and fulfilling. Additionally, implementing functionality
                    like authentication and user categorization presented an exciting challenge and enhanced our
                    technical expertise.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="mt-4">Project Challenges</h3>
                <p>Throughout the project, we encountered several challenges. Integrating a consistent design across
                    various pages required coordination and attention to detail, as our team members had to maintain a
                    unified style while working on separate sections. Moreover, implementing an effective authentication
                    system for user roles and dashboards demanded careful planning to ensure security and functionality.
                    Testing and maintaining code consistency across GitHub branches was another challenge, requiring
                    effective communication and collaboration to resolve merge conflicts and ensure code integrity.</p>
